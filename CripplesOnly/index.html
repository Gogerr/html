        <p>Here at cripples only, we help you to find people in your area who are in a similar situation (physically),
            to you, a cripple.</p>
        <p>There's an ocean full of people and you are but a single fish, so as long
            as you are willing to swim you will find someone.</p>

        <p>Now, currently there are a grand total of 3 cripples in your area, <b><a href="Julian.html">Julian</a></b>,
            <b><a href="Ariel.html">Ariel</a></b>, and <b><a href="Sharon.html">Sharon.</a></b>

        <p>This number is not final, as everyone is a potential cripple! They're just one late debt payment away from
            being
